## Person of Interest Phone Number [Regex, Python]

In one of the episodes in season 2, Harold gives a guy a piece of paper with the first 1000 digits of Pi and tells him that his phone number is on it. I thought this wouldn't actually be that hard to program, and found through this program that there are actually only 6 valid NYC phone numbers that show up in the first 1000 digits of Pi. The numbers in a phone number have to be consecutive in Pi's digits for it to be counted, of course. Otherwise you can make any phone number appear in the first hundred of Pi's digit if you don't read consecutively.
